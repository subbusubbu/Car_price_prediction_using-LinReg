# **Car Price Prediction Using Linear Regression ðŸš—ðŸ’°**
This project aims to predict the price of used cars based on various features such as brand, model, year, engine size, mileage, fuel type, and transmission. The model is built using **Multiple Linear Regression**, and the dataset is sourced from **Kaggle**.

## ðŸ“Œ **Project Overview**
- **Dataset:** Car Price Dataset from Kaggle.
- **Goal:** Predict car prices using historical data and key car attributes.
- **Tech Stack:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
- **Algorithm Used:** Multiple Linear Regression.

## ðŸ“Š **Dataset Description**
The dataset consists of 10,000 rows with the following features:

| Feature         | Description |
|----------------|------------|
| `Brand`        | Car brand (e.g., Volkswagen, Toyota) |
| `Model`        | Specific car model |
| `Year`         | Manufacturing year |
| `Engine_Size`  | Engine size in liters |
| `Fuel_Type`    | Type of fuel (Diesel, Petrol, Electric, Hybrid) |
| `Transmission` | Transmission type (Manual, Automatic, Semi-Automatic) |
| `Mileage`      | Distance covered (in km) |
| `Doors`        | Number of doors |
| `Owner_Count`  | Number of previous owners |
| `Price`        | Target variable (Car Price in USD) |

## ðŸ”§ **Project Workflow**
1. **Data Loading & Exploration**
   - Load dataset using Pandas.
   - Check for missing values and data types.
   - Perform descriptive statistics.

2. **Feature Engineering**
   - Handle categorical variables using **One-Hot Encoding (OHE)**.
   - Drop unnecessary columns.
   - Split data into training and testing sets.

3. **Model Training**
   - Train a **Linear Regression Model** on the training set.
   - Fit the model to predict car prices.

4. **Model Evaluation**
   - Compute **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**, **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**, and **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**.
   - Calculate **RÂ² score** (Coefficient of Determination).

---

## ðŸ“ˆ **Model Performance**
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** `20.00`
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** `4213.92`
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):** `64.91`
- **RÂ² Score:** `0.9995` (99% Accuracy)

ðŸš€ The model performs exceptionally well, achieving **99% accuracy** in predicting car prices!
